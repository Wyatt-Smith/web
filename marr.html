			<p>Johnny Marr was guitarist and co-songwriter for The Smiths, a rock band from the 80s. His jangly arpeggios have been endlessly influential in indie rock. On the band's albums, Marr was well known for using overdubs, letting him get sounds onto the record that couldn't physically be played by one person.
