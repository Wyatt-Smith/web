	<h2>Johnny Marr</h2>
	<p>Johnny Marr was guitarist and co-songwriter for The Smiths, a rock band from the 80s. His jangly arpeggios have been endlessly influential in indie rock. On the band's albums, Marr was well known for using overdubs, letting him get sounds onto the record that couldn't physically be played by one person.

	<h2>Jimi Hendrix</h2>
	<p>Hendrix is considered the greatest guitarist ever. He perfected use of the wah pedal, octave bends and double stops. He invented his own style of simultaneous rhythm and lead guitar. His playing on songs such as All Along the Watchtower and Little Wing are too good for this world.
